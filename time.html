        <p id = "history-text">The master sorcerer Agamotto fashioned a containment device to better wield the stone's dangerous power. When Agamotto founded the Masters of the Mystic Arts, usage of the Eye became forbidden, though Cagliostro was permitted to study the artifact and eventually wrote how to control the relic in his book. It then was passed down to the Ancient One and finally Doctor Strange.</p>

        <p id = "powers-text">When contained in a device capable of harnessing its power, such as the Eye of Agamotto or the Infinity Gauntlet, the Stone's power uniquely manifests in the form of mystical green runes of energy surrounding the user's arm and wrist. Manipulation of time then occurs primarily through the conjuration of a green, circular mandala made of energy in the user's hand.</p>
