        <p id = "history-text">The Mind Stone was originally portrayed as a power source for the Scepter. The Scepter was transported to the HYDRA Research Base in Sokovia, where Wolfgang von Strucker and his scientists began to study it, and powered up a large number of Chitauri Guns using it. After the avengers retrieved it, Stark and Banner found inside the Gem on the scepter a net of neurons which could be configured into artificial intelligence. After the Ultron disaster, with the help of the Regeneration Cradle, the Mind Stone gave birth to the Vision.</p>

        <p id = "powers-text">At its core, the Stone contains a highly advanced intelligence framework, akin to an incredibly powerful supercomputer operating similarly to a sentient mind. The Stone's intelligence is powerful enough to enhance and spontaneously grant sentience to the artificial beings Ultron and Vision. Contained within a Scepter capable of harnessing its power, the Mind Stone's power can dominate the minds of others on contact, placing them under the control of the wielder and loyal to their commands indefinitely.</p>
