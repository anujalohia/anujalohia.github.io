        <p id = "history-text">The Power Stone was used by the Celestial being Eson the Searcher to destroy planets and civilizations until it was forgotten inside the Orb for millennia. It was later in possession of a group of Cosmic Beings who attempted to harness the power of the Stone by sharing its power between them, achieved this by linking themselves together. Eventually it was retrived by the Guardians of the Galaxy who managed to protect it from the Kree warrior Ronan and gave it to Xandar from where it was stolen by Thanos. </p>

        <p id = "powers-text">As the Infinity Stone that embodies both the sustaining and destructive forces of the universe, the Power Stone grants its wielder tremendous energy manipulation capabilities. Due to the amount of energy the Power Stone releases, it is the most destructive out of all the Infinity Stones in terms of raw power. Wielders of the Power Stone are able to project fiery purple energy beams and waves, strong enough to destroy an entire planet. The Stone's energy also enhances the user's strength and durability made possible by instilling the brunt of its power into its wielder.</p>
